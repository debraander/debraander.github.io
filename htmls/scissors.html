	    <h1>Scissors</h1>
        <p>As you can see, there are many, many types of scissors that can be used
           for tying flies. The most important features are that the scissors be very sharp and
           have a fine point for close-in work. Stainless steel and ceramic models are
           the best. Ceramics cost more but never need sharpening.
        </p>
        <p>Many flytiers keep their scissors in the palm of their hand while they tie.
           This is a good habit to learn, because you will always know where your scissors are.
           Spring-type scissors (see image below) are designed for palming.
        </p>
        <p>Also, be sure to use scissors that are comfortable.
