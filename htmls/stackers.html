	    <h1>Hair Stacker</h1>
        <p>A hair stacker is an essential tool for straightening up the tips
            of many types of fibers. 
        </p>
        <p>To use a stacker, place the funnel into the stacker. Put a small clump
            of hair into the funnel, tips first. Tap the stacker firmly against
            a hard surface a few times. Remove the funnel and grasp the tips of
            hair fibers. The tips should then be perfectly aligned.
        </p>
        <p>Does that make sense? Probably not, but if you watch the video
            to the right, you will see how it's done!
