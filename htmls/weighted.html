	    <h1>Weighting</h1>
        <p>Streamer and nymph patterns are often more effective when fished deep. Many fly 
            anglers just pinch a split shot onto their leaders, but split shot can weaken a 
            delicate leader, interfere with your casting, or fall off.
        </p>
        <p>The best way to get the fly down in the current is to add weight to the hook
            before tying the fly. You can weight the hook by wrapping the shank with lead
            or a substitute, or adding a drilled metal bead as a head.
        </p>
        <p>The videos to the right demonstrate each method of adding weight.
