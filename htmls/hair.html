        <p>Animal hair is one of the most versatile fly-tying materials. The natural
            vaiations in color, size, density, buoyancy, and texture make this an 
            essential part of any flytier's inventory. Common
            hair types include deer, elk, moose, calf, and squirrel.
        </p>
        <p>Hair is used mostly for tails, wings, and bodies on dry-fly patters.
