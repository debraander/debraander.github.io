	    <h1>Fur</h1>
        <p>Finer in texture than hair, fur is ued to make <em>dubbing</em>, which is 
            applied to the tying thread.
        </p>
        <p>Different fur colors, both dyed and natural, can be blended to form dubbed
            bodies that closely resemble those of real insects. Long, stiff fur fibers,
            called guard hairs, are used for making nymph bodies and the tails of some flies.
