        <p>The most commonly used feathers for tying:
        </p>
        <p><em>Hackle feathers</em>: The term hackle has two different meanings in fly tying. It is used to describe the collar of fibers near the head of
            a fly, but it also refers to the neck, back, or tail feathers of fowl. These feathers are used for tying tails, wings,
            and hackle.
        </p>
        <p><em>Wing feathers</em>: fibers from a primary wing feather of a turkey, duck, or goose are commonly used for wings on
            wet and dry flies.
        </p>
        <p><em>Body, head, and tail feathers</em>: These are used primarily for winging dry, wet, and salmon flies.
