        <p>The bobbin performs several important functions. It holds the spool of 
            thread as you tie, allows you to wrap the thread onto the hook precisely
            where you want it, and it maintains proper tension on the thread.
        </p>
        <p>Whenever you pause to add or trim materials, you can let the bobbin hang. The
            weight of the bobbin keeps the thread in place. If you like, you can add extra
            weight to your bobbin by inserting lead into the spool.
        </p>
        <p>The most popular style is the open frame. Choose a bobbin that feels comfortable
            in your hand.
