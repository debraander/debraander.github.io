        <p>Fly-tying thread secures the materials onto the hook while adding
            as little bulk as possible. When choosing a fly-tying thread, consider diameter,
            material, and strength.
        </p>
        <p>Until recently, fly-tying thread was made of silk, and many flytiers still feel it
            is superior, but the majority of flytiers have turned to synthetic threads. Synthetics
            allow you to use finer diameter threads without sacrificing strength. They come in 
            a wider choice of colors and are available prewaxed, which means they hold materials
            better than silk does.
        </p>
        <p>Recent innovations in thread include new materials, such as Kevlar and Spectra, which
            are virtually unbreakable.
