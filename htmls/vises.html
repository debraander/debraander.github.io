	    <h1>Vises</h1>
        <p>A good fly-tying vise should be easy to use, hold the hook securely (see image below), 
           and adjust easily to a wide range of hook sizes. Spring-loaded vices are the most
           popular because they automatically adjust to almost any size hook.
        </p>
        <p>Vises come in clamp and pedestal models (see images to the right). Pedestal models
           should be heavy enough to stay put as you tie. Because of their weight, they are less
            portable than clamp models. Clamp models attach securely to a surface as long as it is
            an appropriate thickness.
        </p>
        <p>Vises are not cheap, but having a good quality vise is essential!
